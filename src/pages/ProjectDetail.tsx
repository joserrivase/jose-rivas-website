  langlio: {
    id: 1,
    name: "Langlio",
    tagline: "Turning curiosity for languages into an interactive challenge.",
    description: "A language guessing game that challenges your knowledge of languages and countries while teaching you what you don't know. Built to promote a fun way to get familiar with different languages.",
    impact: "Reached 1000 views in the first 2 weeks",
    skills: ["Website Building", "AI", "Data Analysis", "Product Management"],
    link: "https://langlio.io",
    whyBuilt: "This idea came from playing different daily guessing games, with one in particular sparking the idea: Worldle. I thought of other world related topics and I came across languages. This was something that wasn't already made, it involved my curiosity of the world, and seemed like a fun project to create. It would be a plus if people actually wanted to use it.",
    howBuilt: "I built Langlio using a simple web stack: HTML for the structure, JavaScript for the game logic, and CSS for the design. I used Cursor to help streamline development and organize the code. The game features 70 of the worldâ€™s most spoken languages, with sentences generated from a list of quotes and translations provided by Google Translate. To understand how players engaged with the game, I integrated Google Analytics to track usage patterns, user sources, retention, churn, and interaction data.",
    learned: "Langlio taught me the full product lifecycle, from idea to launch to iteration. I learned how to design and build a website from scratch, analyze user data to make product decisions, and collaborate across roles to manage everything from development to user experience.",
    outcome: "Langlio was able to reach 1000 views in the first month across 9 countries. Based on user feedback, I redesigned the website, leading to a 20% increase in user retention. Using social media I was able to increase website visits by 25% coming mostly from Youtube."

  "ai-listing-improver": {
    id: 2,
    name: "AI-Powered Listing Improver for Excel",
    tagline: "Streamlining e-commerce listing enhancement with AI and VBA automation.",
    description: "An Excel file that uses the OpenAI API to automate the generation of descriptions, attributes, and other listing characteristics.",
    impact: "Accelerated the product content improvement process by 70%",
    skills: ["VBA", "Excel", "AI", "API", "Automation", "E-commerce"],
    link: "#",
    whyBuilt: "I was working with e-commerce product listings and noticed that creating quality descriptions and attributes for hundreds of products was incredibly time-consuming and repetitive. I wanted to leverage AI to automate this process while maintaining quality, allowing teams to focus on more strategic tasks instead of manual data entry.",
    howBuilt: "I developed a VBA-powered Excel solution that integrates with the OpenAI API. The tool reads product data from Excel sheets, sends it to OpenAI with carefully crafted prompts, and automatically populates cells with AI-generated descriptions, attributes, and other listing details. I built custom functions and user forms to make it easy for non-technical users to operate.",
    learned: "This project deepened my understanding of VBA programming and API integration within Excel. I learned how to craft effective prompts for AI to generate consistent, high-quality e-commerce content. I also gained experience in creating user-friendly tools for non-technical users and understanding the importance of error handling and data validation in automation tools.",
    outcome: "The tool accelerated the product content improvement process by 70%, saving countless hours of manual work. It enabled the team to process hundreds of product listings efficiently while maintaining quality standards. The success of this project demonstrated the power of combining traditional tools like Excel with modern AI capabilities."

  "document-creator": {
    id: 3,
    name: "Automated Document Creator",
    tagline: "Automating repetitive document generation with the power of VBA and Apps Script",
    description: "An automated template and document filler that requires the input once and fills out all the given documents.",
    impact: "Reduced repetitive document generation time by 80%",
    skills: ["VBA", "Excel", "Apps Script", "Google Sheets", "Automation"],
    link: "#",
    whyBuilt: "I observed that many business processes involved filling out the same information across multiple document templates repeatedly. This was not only time-consuming but also prone to human error. I wanted to create a solution that would allow users to input their data once and automatically populate all necessary documents, eliminating redundancy and improving accuracy.",
    howBuilt: "I created a dual-platform solution using VBA for Excel and Google Apps Script for Google Sheets. The system reads data from a single input form or spreadsheet, then automatically populates multiple document templates with the appropriate information. I built in validation checks to ensure data accuracy and created a simple interface that guides users through the process.",
    learned: "This project taught me how to work across different platforms (Microsoft and Google ecosystems) and create compatible solutions. I learned about template design, data mapping, and the importance of creating robust automation that handles edge cases. I also gained insights into change management and how to help teams adopt new automated workflows.",
    outcome: "The automated document creator reduced repetitive document generation time by 80%, dramatically improving efficiency. It eliminated data entry errors and freed up team members to focus on higher-value tasks. The tool has been successfully adopted across multiple workflows, proving the value of smart automation in everyday business processes."
